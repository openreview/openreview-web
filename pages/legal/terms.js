        <h3>Submitter&rsquo;s Representations and Warranties</h3>
        <p>The Submitter of any Work makes the following representations and warranties:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Submitter is an original author of the Work, or a proxy authorized to act on
            behalf of the original Author(s).
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Work was created by multiple Authors, the Submitter warrants that all of
            them have consented to the submission of the Work to OpenReview and to these Terms
            of Use.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Submitter has the right to include any third-party materials used in the Work.
          </li>
          <li>
            The use of any third-party materials is consistent with scholarly and academic
            standards of proper citation and acknowledgement of sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Work is not subject to any agreement, license or other claim that could
            interfere with the rights granted herein.
          </li>
          <li>
            The distribution of the Work by OpenReview will not violate any rights of any
            person or entity, including without limitation any rights of copyright, patent,
            trade secret, privacy, or any other rights, and it contains no defamatory, obscene,
            or other unlawful matter.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Submitter has authority to make the statements, grant the rights, and take the
            actions described above.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Article License</h3>
        <p>
          OpenReview does not ask that copyright for submitted Articles or Article Edits be
          transferred to OpenReview. However, we require sufficient rights to allow us to
          distribute the Work in perpetuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Submitter grants to OpenReview upon submission of an Article or Article Edit a
          non-exclusive, perpetual, and royalty-free license to include the Work in the
          OpenReview Database and permit users to access, view, and make other uses of the work
          in a manner consistent with the OpenReview Purpose and operation of the OpenReview
          System (&ldquo;License&rdquo;). This License includes without limitation the right
          for OpenReview to reproduce (e.g., upload, backup, archive, preserve, and allow
          online access), distribute (e.g., allow access), make available, and prepare versions
          of the Work (e.g., abstracts, and metadata or text files, formats to support
          accessibility, machine-readable formats) in analog, digital, or other formats as
          OpenReview may deem appropriate. OpenReview may assign or transfer these rights to a
          successor or assignee, for example if OpenReview services move to another steward.
          These Terms of Service will be binding on, and inure to the benefit of permitted
          successors and assignees.
        </p>
        <p>
          This grant to OpenReview is a non-exclusive license and is not a grant of exclusive
          rights or a transfer of the copyright. The authors retain their copyright and may
          enter into publication agreements or other arrangements, so long as they do not
          conflict with the ability of OpenReview to exercise its rights under the License.
          OpenReview has no obligation to protect or enforce any copyright in the Work, and
          OpenReview has no obligation to respond to any permission requests or other inquiries
          regarding the copyright in or other uses of the Work.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenReview asks that Venues and/or Authors indicate an Article&rsquo;s copyright
          license in the Article&rsquo;s &ldquo;license&rdquo; Database field, typically as a
          short name for well-known licenses (such as &ldquo;CC BY 4.0&rdquo;) or a URL to a
          webpage with unchanging license information. Venues or Authors submitting this
          &ldquo;license&rdquo; field warrant that the associated Article is indeed released
          under the indicated license. OpenReview further encourages use of Creative Commons
          licenses. When no &ldquo;license&rdquo; field is present in an Article, the way to
          find out the license is to contact the associated Venue or Authors to ask for license
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that some OpenReview Venues allow preprints or anonymous submissions. If the
          authors wish to later submit the same Article to another Venue, journal, conference,
          or other publisher, it is the responsibility of the Submitter to ensure that the
          license associated with the OpenReview-submitted Article is compatible with the
          requirements of the later publisher.
        </p>

        <h3>Comment and Configuration Record License</h3>
        <p>
          By submitting a Comment or Configuration Record (and their accompanying Edits) to
          OpenReview the Submitter agrees that it shall be released to the public under the{' '}
          <a
            href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="nofollow no referrer"
          >
            Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
          </a>{' '}
          license. By agreeing to these Terms of Use, Submitters also retroactively apply this
          license to such Comments and Configuration Records they submitted in the past. (Note
          that this license does not imply that all Comments or Configuration Records are
          publicly readable through the OpenReview API; the readability of any Work is
          determined by its &ldquo;readers&rdquo; and &ldquo;nonreaders&rdquo; fields in the
          OpenReview Database, which in turn may be controlled by those with write permission
          to the Work, typically the Authors and/or Solicitors of the Work.)
        </p>

        <h3>Metadata Dedication</h3>
        <p>
          To the extent that the Submitter or OpenReview has a copyright interest in metadata
          associated with a Work, a{' '}
          <a
            href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0"
            target="_blank"

          </a>{' '}
          will apply.
        </p>

        <h3>Waiver of Rights regarding Submissions</h3>
        <p>
          Users waive the following claims, on behalf of themselves and the Authors of any Work
          they submit:
        </p>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            Any claims against OpenReview or OpenReview Editors, based upon actions taken by

            changes affecting the Work, including the identification of Submitters, Authors,

            Work to researchers or other users of OpenReview, including any decision to include
            the Work initially or remove or disable access.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any claims against OpenReview or OpenReview Editors based upon any loss of content
            or disclosure of information provided in connection with a Submission.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any rights related to the integrity of the Work under Moral Rights principles.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that OpenReview and OpenReview Staff are a Data Controller
          only for Works for which &ldquo;OpenReview.net&rdquo; is the Solicitor. With respect
          to all other Works, OpenReview is a Data Processor but not a Data Controller; in this
          case the Data Controller is the Work&rsquo;s Solicitor (for example, the Venue
          inviting the Submissions).
        </p>
        <p>
          Solicitors acknowledge that they are a Data Controller in respect of any Personal
          Data they solicit from Users. Solicitors agree to (a) process personal data accessed
          and/or provided to you through the System only for the Agreed Purposes, (b) not
          disclose or allow access to such personal data to anyone other than the Permitted
          Recipients, and (c) ensure that you have in place Appropriate Technical and
          Organizational Measures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful Processing of
          personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal
          data. Solicitors acknowledge and agree that they will not unnecessarily request
          Sensitive Personal Information from other users. Solicitors acknowledge and agree
          that OpenReview Editors can monitor requests to provide Sensitive Personal
          Information and require you to remove such requests. You acknowledge and agree that
          Processing, storing and transmitting Sensitive Personal Information is unnecessary
          for use of the OpenReview System and that you shall be solely responsible for any
          such use, and therefore OpenReview and OpenReview Staff shall not be liable for the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          You shall indemnify OpenReview and OpenReview Staff against all liabilities, costs,
          expenses, damages and losses (including but not limited to any direct, indirect or
          consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation and all interest, penalties
          and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and all other professional
          costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by OpenReview arising out of or in
          connection with the breach of the Data Protection Legislation by you, your employees
          or agents.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of your use of the System, you may have access to Personal Data provided or
          made available by other users. You understand and agree that you should handle such
          Personal Data in compliance with regulations applicable in relevant jurisdictions.
          OpenReview and the OpenReview Editors are not responsible for ensuring that Users
          comply with such regulations. You also acknowledge that, given the nature of the
          System usage, any Personal Data that you provide or make available to other users is
          likely to be transferred outside of the European Economic Area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any material breach of data protection legislation regulations by you shall be
          grounds for OpenReview to suspend or terminate your use of the System.

        <p>
          In order to operate and provide the System, we collect certain information about you,
          as described in the OpenReview Privacy Policy. As part of your interaction with the

          acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf of the Governments of Iran, Syria, Cuba, or
          any other jurisdiction subject to comprehensive economic sanctions by the United
          States, or any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof (other than

          programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States
          Department of the Treasury (OFAC) and are not listed or identified on the List of

        </p>

        <h3>User Registration, Account and Password</h3>
        <p>
          In order to access some features of the System, Users must register. To begin
          registration you may visit the web page inviting you to create a new login account.
          First the System will ask for your name, email, and a newly-created password. Your
          user id is created automatically from your name. We will then send an email to you in
          order to confirm the email address for your account. This email will include a link
          inviting you to complete the registration by entering required additional Profile
          information such as your organization and homepage URL, and other optional
          information such as your profile URLs on other scientific publishing services (e.g.
          Google Scholar and ORCHID), and additional information that will aid Venues in
          determining conflicts of interest.
        </p>
        <p>User registration and account terms:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is a violation of our policies to misrepresent your identity or organizational
            affiliation or homepage URL. Claimed affiliation should be current in the
            conventional sense: e.g., physical presence, funding, email address, etc.
            Misrepresentation of identity or affiliation, for any reason, may result in
            immediate and permanent suspension from use of the OpenReview System. You agree to
            provide registration and Profile information that is true, accurate, current, and
            complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each user may have only one registered OpenReview account. If you are attempting to
            register a new account and are already registered or have an
            automatically-pre-created account with the same name, these other accounts will
            appear, and allow you to claim them, and have such claims reviewed by OpenReview
            staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            You agree to maintain and promptly update the Profile information to keep it true,
            accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue,
            inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect
            that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, OpenReview,
            in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and
            refuse you any and all current or future use of the System.
          </li>
          <li>
            You agree and understand that you are fully responsible for all activities that
            occur under any account you use to access the System.
          </li>
          <li>
            You must keep your password confidential and not authorize any third party to
            access or use the System on your behalf. You understand that any third party that
            has access to your account can reset your password, disable your access to the
            System, view any content accessible from your account, or post any content,
            including content that violates these Terms of Use or other laws, regulations, or
            rules. You remain fully liable to and will indemnify and hold harmless OpenReview
            Editors against claims, actions, proceedings, losses, damages, expenses and costs
            (including without limitation court costs and reasonable legal fees) arising out of
            or in connection with any third party&rsquo;s use of your account and password or
            the System on your behalf.
          </li>
          <li>
            You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or
            account.
          </li>
          <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that if OpenReview Editors disable access to your
            account, or restrict your permissions, you may be prevented from accessing the
            System, your account details, or some Works that were previously accessible to you
            via the System.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As with all passwords, we recommend that you keep your password safe and secure. If
          you forget your password, you can have it reset on the login page. The same process
          is used to change your password.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need to change your preferred email address, for example because you have
          changed institutions, you can do so by editing your Profile. This will allow you to
          add an email address and we will send an email with a verification code to your new
          address to make sure that your new address is correct. Afterwards you can make the
          new email address your preferred address. OpenReview asks that old non-preferred
          email addresses continue to be recorded in your Profile in order to aid with author
          disambiguation, and historical conflict-of-interest detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to add alternative versions of your name (for example, with and without a
          middle name), you can do so by editing your Profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to remove a previously registered name, for example due to a typo at user
          registration time or a change in identity, you can request such a deletion in the
          edit page of your Profile. Such requests are reviewed by OpenReview staff because all
          previous uses of your old name (and accompanying user id) must be modified throughout
          all fields of the OpenReview Database, and corner cases in the necessary processing
          sometimes need human intervention.
        </p>

        <h3>User Code of Conduct, Reporting, Consequences</h3>

          writeable exclusively by certain restricted groups of Users, as indicated by the
          Database fields &ldquo;readers&rdquo;, &ldquo;nonreaders&rdquo;, and
          &ldquo;writers.&rdquo; OpenReview Users must not attempt to circumvent these rules,
          nor share beyond the above restrictions information they discover (discovered, for
          example, through intended legitimate use of OpenReview&rsquo;s System, through bugs
          in the OpenReview System, or through channels outside the OpenReview System). If any
          User discovers an apparent security bug in the OpenReview System, the User must

        <p>
          OpenReview Users must not use the OpenReview System in a manner that causes harm to
          the OpenReview System (such as denial of service attacks, bug exploitation, or any

          user-experience of other Users) or compromises the integrity and purpose of the
          OpenReview Database (such as unnecessary content flooding, submitting false or
          misleading metadata, or spoofing). You acknowledge and agree that OpenReview Editors
          may set upper limits on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through
          the System or on the amount of storage space available to any User or Group. Such
          upper limits may be set by OpenReview Editors at any time, at their discretion.
        </p>

          with or without notice to you. Such updates are designed to improve, enhance and
          further develop the OpenReview System and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced
          functions, new modules, or other forms. You agree to permit us to make and deploy

          become effective upon posting. Users will be notified of the date of last update to
          these Terms of Use before logging in to the OpenReview Web Site. The date on the top
          of this document indicates the date the policy was last updated. Your continued use
          of the OpenReview System after these Terms of Use has been modified means that you

          notice or choice in the event we make any material changes to these Terms of Use. It
          is your responsibility to review these Terms of Use periodically to become aware of
          any modifications.
        </p>

        <h3>General Legal Terms</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms of Use constitute the entire contract between you and us regarding the
          System. It supersedes and extinguishes any prior contract, warranties,
          representations, understandings or other oral or written statements regarding your
          use of the System.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that in using the System you do not rely on, and shall have no
          remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether
          made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          All parts of these Terms of Use apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant
          law. If any part of these Terms of Use is or becomes invalid, illegal or
          unenforceable, it shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it
          valid, legal and enforceable. If such modification is not possible, the relevant
          provision or part-provision shall be deemed deleted. Any modification to or deletion
          of a provision or part-provision shall not affect the validity and enforceability of
          the rest of the Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, to the extent
          permitted by law, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of
          the System or the Terms of Use must be filed within six months after such claim or
          cause of action arose or be forever barred.
        </p>
        <p>
          These Terms of Use and the relationship between you and OpenReview and any dispute or
          claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection
          with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by, and construed in
          accordance with the law of Massachusetts and the United States of America. In
          relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this
          Terms of Use (&ldquo;Proceedings&rdquo;), each of the parties irrevocably agrees that
          the courts of Massachusetts and the United States of America shall have exclusive
          jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or
          claims) arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Use or their subject
          matter or formation and waives any objection to Proceedings in such courts on the
          grounds of venue or on the grounds that Proceedings have been brought in an
          inappropriate forum.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenReview Staff shall not be in breach of these Terms nor liable for delay in
          performing, or failure to perform, any of its obligations under these Terms of Use if
          such delay or failure result from events, circumstances or causes beyond its
          reasonable control.
        </p>
        <p>
          A waiver of any right or remedy under these Terms of Use or by law is only effective
          if given in writing and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent right or
          remedy. A failure or delay by OpenReview Staff to exercise any right or remedy
          provided under these Terms of Use or by law shall not constitute a waiver of that or
          any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict any further exercise of
          that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of any right or
          remedy provided under these Terms of Use or by law shall prevent or restrict the
          further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.
