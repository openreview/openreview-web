          OpenReview is dedicated to protecting your personal information and will make every

        <h3>What Information We Collect From You</h3>
        <strong>Information we gather when you visit the website or use the API</strong>
        <p>
          Whether the user is logged in or not, OpenReview collects information of the sort
          that web browsers typically make available (such as IP address, browser type,
          language preference, referring site, pages viewed, dates and times). In addition we
          use cookies (analytics, login cookies, and local storage). We use this information
          for the legitimate interests of administering the sites, malicious activity tracking,
          business analysis, research, and development. We also capture information related to
          how you interact with our products and services (including API calls) for the
          legitimate interest of business analysis, research, and development. This allows us
          to understand better how our visitors use the website, to refine the design of the
          site, improve the user experience, and decide where to target software development
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use (or may use in future) cookies and similar technologies (including local
          storage, web beacons, and clear GIFs) to enhance your experience with the website and
          for analytics purposes. Cookies are small text files stored on your computer and
          accessible only to the websites that created them. Cookies are used to recognize you
          and to keep track of your preferences. If you are a registered user, OpenReview uses
          cookies to keep you logged into secure areas of the website. It is not necessary to
          permit cookies in order to read articles on OpenReview.net, but certain features of
          our websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. If you would like
          to disable or otherwise manage the cookies placed on your computer or other device by
          us and others, please use your browser settings. Note that you will need to set your
          cookie preferences on each device and each web browser that you use. The independent
          AboutCookies.org website contains comprehensive information on how to modify your
          browser settings. You can conceal your true IP address by using a virtual private
          network (VPN).

          The complete record of all OpenReview API traffic is logged and kept for 90 days,
          including the IP address of the caller, and all arguments appearing in the URL. For a
          subset of API operations that store data in the system (POST/PUT/DELETE) we store in
          perpetuity (with access only to OpenReview administrators) all aspects of the API
          call, except password, but including IP address, user id making the API call,
          complete URL, and API body arguments. These logs are used by OpenReview Staff to
          debug the system, and occasionally to answer requests by Venue Organizers about
          author or reviewer activity (such as requests for a User&rsquo;s last login date,
          file upload attempts, and failed submission attempts during the deadline).
        </p>
        <strong>Information we gather from registered users and public sources</strong>
        <p>
          When you register as a user with OpenReview, we collect certain “Profile”
          information. Name, email address, institution, and homepage URL are required for
          system registration. You may voluntarily provide other optional information, such as
          past email addresses, affiliation history, demographic information, expertise
          description, education history, career history, additional contact information,
          additional homepages (such as those for DBLP, LinkedIn, Wikipedia, Semantic Scholar,
          Google Scholar, ORCHIDid other online identifiers), and conflicts-of-interest, such
          as name and email address of doctoral advisor. (It is your responsibility to obtain
          appropriate consent from any other person whose information you provide.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This Profile information is useful when Venues are striving to build a cohort of
          submission reviewers with a balance of seniority, background, affiliations, and
          expertise, while also avoiding conflicts of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some Profiles are pre-created by aggregating information publicly available on the
          web, such as publication databases (e.g. from DBLP), grant databases (e.g. from NSF),
          directories (e.g. universities&rsquo; public faculty directories), home pages (e.g.
          individuals&rsquo; public home URLs), and other public information sources.
          Pre-created Profiles help Venues find relevant expertise with more diversity than
          they might otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, registered Users may contribute Profile information to other
          users&rsquo; Profiles. For example, a professor&rsquo;s PhD advisee may indicate
          their advisor, causing a new “advisee” relation to appear on the professor&rsquo;s
          profile. Or, one user may contribute information (such as an affiliation) to another
          user&rsquo;s Profile; such information is marked as “unconfirmed” and rendered in
          gray text until it has been confirmed by the Profile owner or other reliable
          validator of factual information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some email addresses are designated “confirmed email addresses” when the user has
          clicked on a link sent to that email address by the OpenReview system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some names are designated “confirmed names” when the user presses the save button in
          a profile containing those names.
        </p>
        <p>
          All “Profile” information can be viewed publicly on your OpenReview profile page,
          with two exceptions:{' '}
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Email addresses are obfuscated by showing email domain only. Full email addresses
            are, however, shared with Venue Organizers (such as journal editors and program
            chairs, who may at their discretion further share with subordinates, such as action
            editors or area chairs). Designation as a “Venue Organizer” is granted at the
            discretion of the OpenReview Staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selected conflicts-of-interest and other relations may be hidden by the Profile
            owner from all but a designated list of readers. For example, designated readers
            may include certain Venue Organizers selected by the Profile owner.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The Profile owner may directly change or modify all Profile information, except
          confirmed email addresses and confirmed names (although these may be changed at
          special request by sending email to{' '}
          <a href="mailto:profiles@openreview.net">profiles@openreview.net</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Edit history of Profile content is stored in the system, available to the Profile
          owner, the creator of the Profile-edit in question, and the OpenReview Database
          administrators.
        </p>
        <strong>Information gathered upon submission of articles and comments</strong>
        <p>
          Registered users may submit to OpenReview Venues Articles, Comments, and other Works,
          such as reviews and discussion. The content data fields are specified by the Venue
          Organizers. Additional Metadata fields gathered by the OpenReview system include the
          account name of the person submitting the content, and date of submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the content submission and moderation process we link user accounts, authorship,
          and submitted content to track and process submissions. Data provided by the
          submitter may include, for example, author names, author emails, and submitter name,
          all of which may be displayed (depending on the readability policy of the Venue) with
          the article posting, email announcement of articles, and bulk metadata access via
          API. It is the responsibility of the submitter to obtain appropriate consent from any
          other person whose information the submitter provides.
        </p>
        <strong>Other Information you may provide us voluntarily</strong>
        <p>
          Users may voluntarily provide other information, such as when they email OpenReview
          support (<a href="mailto:info@openreview.net">info@openreview.net</a>) for technical
          help requests. Users may also submit other types of information voluntarily through
          the OpenReview web site, such as ratings, reviewing bids, tags, comments, and
          preferences. Such information will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>How we use information about you that we collect</h3>
        <p>
          We use the information that we collect to better understand how users use the System,
          to support efforts to improve Users&rsquo; experience through refining existing
          features and developing new features, and to optimize the System. We also use the
          information to administer the OpenReview API and website and verify accounts and
          activity and to monitor suspicious activity to help prevent abuse. In addition, we
          use and make available the information for the OpenReview Purpose and scientific
          communication purpose for which it was provided. Furthermore, if you email us about
          an issue, we will use your information to respond to your question. We will also use
          your information to communicate with you regarding the OpenReview System and your
          account with us.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Control Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          The Venue Organizers and other Solicitors are considered the stewards and managers of
          Works for which they are the Solicitor, not OpenReview, which serves merely as the
          repository. Venue Organizers and other Solicitors are also stewards and managers of
          content about you that you did not submit, such as the assignment of reviewers to
          Submissions. The Venue Organizers and other Solicitors determine when, to whom, and
          how much of your information in Works they solicit is shared with others. More
          specifically, OpenReview and OpenReview Staff are a Data Controller (in the GDPR
          sense) only for Works for which “OpenReview.net” is the Solicitor. With respect to
          all other Works, OpenReview is a Data Processor but not a Data Controller; in this
          case the Data Controller is the Work&rsquo;s Solicitor (for example, the Venue
          soliciting the Article Submissions).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you choose to submit an Article or any other Work, it is important that you
          understand the terms and conditions set by the Solicitor. The practices regarding the
          level of openness vary throughout OpenReview.net, as determined by the Solicitor. For
          example, depending on the policies of a Venue, content submitted by users to that
          Venue may be freely accessible and available to any third-party use. Your Submission
          of a Work constitutes your acceptance of the level of sharing planned by the
          applicable Solicitor.
        </p>

        <h3>With whom we share your information</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Venue Organizers, other Solicitors, and other Users.</strong> Generally
          speaking, information sharing choices are determined by the Venue or other Solicitor
          of Works containing the information. (The Solicitor is the Data Controller, while
          OpenReview, OpenReview Staff, and the OpenReview System are the Data Processors.)
          When a user responds to a Solicitor&rsquo;s invitation to upload a Work to the
          OpenReview System, that work is stored in the OpenReview Database, and assigned
          readers, nonreaders, and writers according to the parameters of the Solicitor&rsquo;s
          invitation. The OpenReview System will thus share the Work you upload according to
          the Work&rsquo;s “readers” and “nonreaders” Database fields. Users with “write”
          permission (typically the Venue Organizers and Authors) to the Work may also be
          invited to modify the Work, including its “readers” and “nonreaders” fields.
          Typically the Venue or other Solicitor publicly discloses its intended workflow, and
          Submitters can thus know in advance the schedule and extent of information sharing
          planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Service Providers.</strong> We use third party service providers to help us
          operate the OpenReview System. These third party vendors have access to some
          information about our Users, but they are required to protect the confidentiality of
          the information and to use it only on our behalf. The types of service providers with
          which we share include providers of email services, other communication services,
          website development, website hosting, analytics, and security.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Legal compliance.</strong> OpenReview will also share information about users
          when required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is
          necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to respond to a court order,
          subpoena or search warrant. We will also share information if we believe that it is
          necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of OpenReview or others. If we
          share information about you for this reason, we will use reasonable efforts to inform
          you of this disclosure, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Business Transactions.</strong> We may also share information in connection
          with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or
          acquisition of all or a portion of our business.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Consent.</strong> We will also share your information in the event that you
          consent to us sharing it in a certain way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>De-identified Information.</strong> If we have de-identified your information
          such that it can no longer be linked directly to you, we may use and share such
          de-identified information for purposes of analyzing, debugging, or improving the
          OpenReview System and OpenReview Purpose.
        </p>

        <h3>Protecting your information</h3>
        <p>
          No method of transmitting data over the internet or storing electronic data is 100%
          secure, but OpenReview aims to provide technical and organizational methods to
          protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information that is under our
          control.
        </p>

        <h3>Third Party Website Links</h3>
        <p>
          There are links from OpenReview to other websites that we neither own nor control.
          OpenReview is not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or web
          accessibility needs on these websites. These websites have their own privacy policies
          and your visiting these websites from our website is subject to those website&rsquo;s
          own terms and policies. This Privacy Policy covers only information collected through
          OpenReview.net.
        </p>

        <h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3>
        <p>
          Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users may set in certain web
          browsers. We do not currently respond to DNT signals.
        </p>

        <h3>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
        <p>
          If you are located within the European Economic Area (European Union, Norway,
          Liechtenstein, the United Kingdom, and Iceland), we acknowledge the rights granted to
          you under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and provide you with some
          additional information required by the GDPR in this section.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Legal Bases for Processing.</strong> We use a variety of legal bases for
          processing your information, as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Legitimate Interests. We will process your information when it is in our legitimate
            business interests to do so, such as analyzing use of the services, communicating
            with you, enhancing the services, and for other internal business operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance of a contract. We will process your information where it is necessary
            to provide the services of the OpenReview Terms of Use and OpenReview Purpose to
            you and other OpenReview Users, including to manage your registration and provide
            you with access to the System.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consent. We will process your information when you give us consent to process it
            for particular purposes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Subject Rights. </strong> The GDPR offers the following rights to EU
          data subjects:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Right to access your information held by us</li>
          <li>Right to correct inaccurate or incorrect information about you</li>
          <li>
            Right to the erasure of your information when it is no longer necessary for us to
            retain it
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to restrict processing of your personal information in specific situations
          </li>
          <li>
            Right to object to processing your information, including sending you
            communications that may be considered direct-marketing materials
          </li>
          <li>Right to object to automated decision-making and profiling, where applicable</li>
          <li>
            Right to complain to a supervisory authority in your jurisdiction within the EU
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated
          by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from
          such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing
          your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.
          We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity
          before responding to your request as required or permitted by applicable law. Please
          contact us with any questions, concerns, or if you wish to exercise any of these
          rights: privacy@openreview.net.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>International Transfer.</strong> Please note that in providing services to
          you, your information may be transferred and stored in jurisdictions (including the
          United States) other than your jurisdiction of residence, and that such other
          jurisdictions may have data protection laws that differ from those in your
          jurisdiction. By using the website, you acknowledge that these transfers may occur.
        </p>

        <h3>Retention of Information</h3>
        <p>
          We retain your information for no longer than necessary for the OpenReview Purpose or
          purposes for which it is processed. The length of time for which we retain
          information depends on the purposes for which we collected and used it and/or as
          required to comply with applicable laws.
        </p>

        <h3>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          Use of OpenReview is intended for adults at least eighteen (18) years of age and we
          do not knowingly collect personally-identifying information from children under the
          age of thirteen (13).
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to this Document</h3>
        <p>
          OpenReview may update this Privacy Policy at any time in its sole discretion. Changes
          become effective upon posting. Users will be notified of the date of last update to
          this Privacy Policy before logging in to the OpenReview Web Site. The date on the top
          of this document indicates the date the policy was last updated. Your continued use
          of the OpenReview System after the Privacy Policy has been modified means that you
          accept the revised terms. We will also comply with any applicable laws governing
