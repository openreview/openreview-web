    id: 'question-add-formatting',
    a: `Venues can choose to allow users to add basic formatting to text content by enabling Markdown in specific places like official reviews and rebuttals. Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on common conventions for indicating formatting and is currently used by many prominent websites including GitHub and StackOverflow. It can be used to add headings, bold, italics, lists, tables, and more. For a brief overview of the features of Markdown see [CommonMark.org’s reference](https://commonmark.org/help/). OpenReview follows the [CommonMark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.29/), with the exception of images and inline HTML which are not supported.

If Markdown is enabled, you will see that the text input has two tabs at the top: Write and Preview. This feature allows you to enter plain text in the Write tab and quickly see what the HTML output will look on the page in the Preview tab.

If Markdown formatting has not been enabled by the venue, you can still format your text using regular line breaks and spaces for indentation.`,

To indicate that some piece of text should be rendered as TeX, use the delimiters \`$...$\` for inline math or \`$$...$$\` for displayed math.
For example, this raw text:
\`\`\`
This is what the Pythagorean theorem $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ looks like.

Here is an example of multiple integrals:

    q: 'How does OpenReview\'s TeX support differ from "real" TeX/LaTeX systems?',
    id: 'question-tex-differences',
    a: `OpenReview uses the open source library [MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/index.html) to render TeX content, and there are some key differences between it and other systems. First and foremost, the TeX input processor implements only the math-mode macros of TeX and LaTeX, not the text-mode macros. So, for example, MathJax does not implement \`\\emph\` or \`\\begin{enumerate}...\\end{enumerate}\` or other text-mode macros or environments. You must use Markdown (if enabled) to handle such formatting tasks.

Second, some features in MathJax might be limited. For example, MathJax only implements a limited subset of the array environment’s preamble; i.e., only the l, r, c, and | characters alongside : for dashed lines — everything else is ignored.

When adding TeX content to a Markdown enabled field, it is important that all backslashes (\\\\) are escaped (i.e. replaced with \\\\\\\\) to prevent Markdown from stripping the backslashes before the TeX notation is parsed. If Markdown is not enabled, this is not necessary.

Keep in mind that your mathematics is part of an HTML document, so you need to be aware of the special characters used by HTML as part of its markup. There cannot be HTML tags within the math delimiters as TeX-formatted math does not include HTML tags. Make sure to add spaces around any \`<\` or \`>\` symbols to ensure they are not treated as open tags.`,
  }, {
    q: 'Why is my LaTeX code not displaying properly?',
    id: 'question-tex-not-displaying-properly',
    a: `One possible reason is that the macro is not supported by MathJax. If this is the case then macro will appear as plain red text in with the rendered TeX.

Another possibility is that the field has Markdown enabled, but not all the backslashes in the TeX notation were escaped. This can lead to some layout problems, such as all the elements of a matrix appearing in 1 row instead of many.

For more details on the difference between OpenReview's TeX support and other systems, see the answer above.`,

#### Navigating the Edge Browser

If the option to modify assignments is available for Area Chairs in your venue, you should find a link to do so in your Area Chair console that will bring you directly to the edge browser.

All of your assigned papers will appear in a single column on the left. Clicking on a paper in the list will pull up a second column containing all reviewers, colored by their relationship to the selected paper:

  1. Light green means that the reviewer is assigned to the paper selected at left.
  2. White means that the reviewer is not assigned to and has no conflict with the paper selected at left.

You can search for specific papers by paper title or number at the top of the first column. At the top of the subsequent column you can also search for specific reviewers by their name, email or profile id. You can sort the column on the right by whatever edge types are shown, such as Assignment, Aggregate Score, Bid, or Affinity Score, using the 'Order By' dropdown. The second column will show the total number of assignments for the selected reviewer.

![Edge Browser](/images/faq-AC-edge-browser.png)

#### Creating and Removing Assignments Using the Edge Browser

You can delete an assignment using the trash can button on a certain Reviewer.

There are two ways to create assignments:

  1. Using the 'Assign' button. This assigns a reviewer to a paper and notifies them by email. The assignment becomes automatically available in the Reviewer and AC consoles.
  2. Using the 'Invite Assignment' button. This is only availble if it has been enabled by the Program Chairs. This sends an invitation to the reviewer with an accept/decline link. The reviewer can then respond to the invitation. If you want to invite a reviewer from outside the reviewer pool, including another Area Chair, you can do so by searching for their email address or profileID in the search bar of the second column and clicking 'Invite Assignment'. If they are in conflict with that paper, a banner will alert you with an error. Otherwise, they will receive an email notifying them of their invitation with the option to accept or reject the assignment. Their status will change according to their response to your invitation ('Declined', 'Pending Sign Up', 'Accepted', or 'Conflict Detected').

<img src="/images/faq-reviewer-declined.png" alt="Reviewer Declined" class="img-answer"/></br>
<img src="/images/faq-reviewer-accepted.png" alt="Reviewer Accepted" class="img-answer"/></br>

Some reviewers have a custom reduced paper load which appears in the edge browser as 'Custom Max Papers'. You cannot directly assign a reviewer to more papers than their custom max papers, but you can 'Invite' reviewers if that option is enabled for you. You can also filter out reviewers who have met their quota with the checkbox 'Only show reviewers with fewer than max assigned papers.'

  2. Under the 'Paper Status' tab in the PC console, click on 'Show Reviewers' next to the paper you want to assign reviewers to.
   - To assign reviewers from the reviewer pool, you can choose a reviewer from the dropdown. Here, you can also search reviewers in the reviewer pool by name or email. After finding the reviewer you want to assign, click on the 'Assign' button.
   - To assign reviewers from outside the reviewer pool, you should type the reviewer's email or OpenReview profile ID (e.g., ~Alan_Turing1) in the textbox and then click on the 'Assign' button. A reviewer does not need to have an OpenReview profile in order to be assigned to a paper.

Note that assigning a reviewer to a paper through the PC console automatically adds that reviewer to the reviewers pool and sends them an email notifying them about their new assignment.

**Area Chairs:** Unfortunately, assigning ACs is not available through the PC console, but manual AC assignments can be made through the Python library: (You can check out the docs for our Python API [here](https://openreview-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))

- You will need to use your own OpenReview credentials to initialize the Client object.
- **request_form_id** (string) refers to the forum id of the venue request for your venue, (e.g., [https://openreview.net/forum?id=**r1lf10zpw4**]())
- **paper_number** (int) is the number of the paper you want to assign an area chair to (you can find this in the 'Paper Status' tab of the PC console)
- **user_id** (string) is the email address or OpenReview profile ID (e.g., ~Alan_Turing1) of the user you want to assign

    a: `#### Running Automatic Paper Matching

In order to automatically assign Reviewers and Area Chairs, you must:

  1. Contact OpenReview in advance of the deadline to calculate your affinity scores and conflicts.
  2. Enable the 'Review Stage' from your venue request form. This can only be done AFTER the submission deadline has passed.

After following these steps, you should see links for 'Assignment' in the 'Timeline' section of your Program Chair console.

![PC Console](/images/faq-PC_Console.png)

Clicking on one of the assignment links will bring you to the assignment page, where you can run paper matching. You can learn more about our automatic paper matching algorithm from its github repo: https://github.com/openreview/openreview-matcher. To create a new matching, click the 'New Assignment Configuration'. This will pull up a form with some default values pertaining to your matching settings:

  - User demand: The number of users available to be assigned to papers

  - Max papers: The maximum number of papers that can be assigned to each reviewer

  - Min papers: The minimum number of papers that can be assigned to each reviewer

  - Scores specification: JSON providing further details and customization to scores, as in the following example:

    \`\`\`
    {
        "Example_Venue/2022/Conference/Reviewers/-/Affinity_Score": {
            "weight": 1,
            "default": 0
        },
        "Example_Venue/2022/Conference/Reviewers/-/Bid": {
            "weight": 1,
            "default": 0,
            "translate_map": {
                "Very High": 1,
                "High": 0.75,
                "Neutral": 0,
                "Low": -0.5,
                "Very Low": -1
            }
        }
    }
    \`\`\`

    Each key represents an edge invitation (affinity score, bid, etc.). Weight can be added to a given score value with the numerical field 'Weight'. 'Default' is a numerical value that is used when there is not an edge for a specific reviewer-paper pair. Finally, 'translate_map' is a map function that translates an edge label value into a number.

    In the example above, the aggregate score being used by the optimizer is:
        weight * (affinity score) + weight * (translate_map(bid))

After filling out this form and hitting submit, you should see the following:

![Assignment Page](/images/faq-assignment-page.png)

You can view, edit or copy the values you filled out in the matching form. When you are happy with it, you should hit 'Run Matcher' and wait until its status is 'Complete'. Then you should see options to browse assignments, view statistics or deploy matching. If you click ‘Browse Assignments’ you will be brought to the edge browser.

#### Manually Editing Assignments with the Edge Browser

The edge browser is a tool for visualizing edges, or matches, created by OpenReview’s automatic paper matching algorithm. You can use it to browse, sort, search, and create new assignments between reviewers and papers until you are happy with the assignments generated. The edge browser is available to venues that selected 'Affinity Scores' or 'Bids' in the Paper Matching section of their venue request form. When you first open the edge browser, all papers will appear in a column on the left. You can click on a certain paper to see a second column of reviewers pop up to the right. Similarly, if you click on a reviewer, all of their assigned papers will pop up in another column to the right, and so on.

The color of each item represents the relationship between that item and the one selected at left:

  1. Light green means that the item is assigned to the item selected at left.
  2. Light red means that the item has conflict with the item selected at left.
  3. Light orange means that the item both has conflict and is assigned to the item selected at left.
  4. White means that the item is not assigned to and has no conflict with the item selected at left.

Each item will display various edges calculated by the matcher and used to make assignments, such as the Bid, Affinity, Aggregate scores, and Conflicts. The trashcan button can be used to remove an edge. You can create new assignments in one of two ways:

  1. The option 'Assign'  directly assigns the reviewer to the paper and sends an email notification.
  2. The option 'Invite Assignment'  sends an invitation email to the reviewer with an accept/decline link.

'Assignments' tells you how many papers are assigned to a given reviewer. You may also see 'Custom Max Papers' here if certain reviewers requested a specific max number of papers. You can filter out reviewers who have met their quota with the checkbox 'Only show reviewers with fewer than max assigned papers.' Once a reviewer has hit their quota, the 'Assign' button will be disabled and you will only be able to assign them additional papers using the 'Invite Assignments' button after deployment.

<img src="/images/faq-assign-button-disabled.png" alt="Assign Button Disabled" class="img-answer"/></br>

You can search for specific papers by paper title or number at the top of the first column. At the top of the subsequent columns you can also search for specific reviewers by profileID, name, or email. You can sort subsequent columns on the right by whatever edges are displayed, such as Assignment, Aggregate Score, Bid, Affinity Score, and/or Conflict, using the 'Order By' dropdown.

You can copy, edit, and create matching configurations as many times as you want until deployment. You can also use the ‘View Statistics’ button on the assignment page to view a breakdown of paper assignments. When you are happy with your assignments, hit 'Deploy Assignments' on the assignment page.

#### Post Deployment

After deploying, 'Browse Assignments' will change to 'Edit assignments' so that you can continue to make manual assignments using either of the options 'Assign' or 'Invite Assignment'.

Any changes made after deployment are immediately visible to the assigned Reviewers or ACs, and it is not necessary to deploy again.

The reviewer can then respond to the invitation. If you want to invite a reviewer from outside the reviewer pool, you can do so by searching for their email address or profileID in the search bar of the second column and clicking 'Invite Assignment'. If they are in conflict with that paper, a banner will alert you with an error. Otherwise, they will receive an email notifying them of their invitation with the option to accept or reject the assignment. Their status will change according to their response to your invitation ('Declined', 'Pending Sign Up', 'Accepted', or 'Conflict Detected').
