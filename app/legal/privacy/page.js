          <h3>What Information We Collect From You</h3>
          <strong>Information we gather when you visit the website or use the API</strong>
          <p>
            Whether the user is logged in or not, OpenReview collects information of the sort
            that web browsers typically make available (such as IP address, browser type,
            language preference, referring site, pages viewed, dates and times). In addition we
            use cookies (analytics, login cookies, and local storage). We use this information
            for the legitimate interests of administering the sites, malicious activity
            tracking, business analysis, research, and development. We also capture information
            related to how you interact with our products and services (including API calls)
            for the legitimate interest of business analysis, research, and development. This
            allows us to understand better how our visitors use the website, to refine the
            design of the site, improve the user experience, and decide where to target
            software development activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use (or may use in future) cookies and similar technologies (including local
            storage, web beacons, and clear GIFs) to enhance your experience with the website
            and for analytics purposes. Cookies are small text files stored on your computer
            and accessible only to the websites that created them. Cookies are used to
            recognize you and to keep track of your preferences. If you are a registered user,
            OpenReview uses cookies to keep you logged into secure areas of the website. It is
            not necessary to permit cookies in order to read articles on OpenReview.net, but
            certain features of our websites may not function properly without the aid of
            cookies. If you would like to disable or otherwise manage the cookies placed on
            your computer or other device by us and others, please use your browser settings.
            Note that you will need to set your cookie preferences on each device and each web
            browser that you use. The independent AboutCookies.org website contains
            comprehensive information on how to modify your browser settings. You can conceal
            your true IP address by using a virtual private network (VPN).

            We use Google Analytics to gather and summarize web analytical data. A description

            The complete record of all OpenReview API traffic is logged and kept for 90 days,
            including the IP address of the caller, and all arguments appearing in the URL. For
            a subset of API operations that store data in the system (POST/PUT/DELETE) we store
            in perpetuity (with access only to OpenReview administrators) all aspects of the
            API call, except password, but including IP address, user id making the API call,
            complete URL, and API body arguments. These logs are used by OpenReview Staff to
            debug the system, and occasionally to answer requests by Venue Organizers about
            author or reviewer activity (such as requests for a User&rsquo;s last login date,
            file upload attempts, and failed submission attempts during the deadline).
          </p>
          <strong>Information we gather from registered users and public sources</strong>
          <p>
            When you register as a user with OpenReview, we collect certain “Profile”
            information. Name, email address, current position (university, company,
            self-employed) with its location, and a URL clearly showing your name are required
            for system registration. You may voluntarily provide other optional information,
            such as past email addresses, affiliation history, past demographic information,
            expertise description, education history, career history, additional contact
            information, additional homepages (such as those for DBLP, LinkedIn, Wikipedia,
            Semantic Scholar, Google Scholar, ORCHIDid other online identifiers), and
            conflicts-of-interest, such as name and email address of doctoral advisor. (It is
            your responsibility to obtain appropriate consent from any other person whose
            information you provide.)
          </p>
          <p>
            This Profile information is useful when Venues are striving to build a cohort of
            submission reviewers with a balance of seniority, background, affiliations, and
            expertise, while also avoiding conflicts of interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some Profiles are pre-created by aggregating information publicly available on the
            web, such as publication databases (e.g. from DBLP), grant databases (e.g. from
            NSF), directories (e.g. universities&rsquo; public faculty directories), home pages
            (e.g. individuals&rsquo; public home URLs), and other public information sources.
            Pre-created Profiles help Venues find relevant expertise with more diversity than
            they might otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, registered Users may contribute Profile information to other
            users&rsquo; Profiles. For example, a professor&rsquo;s PhD advisee may indicate
            their advisor, causing a new “advisee” relation to appear on the professor&rsquo;s
            profile. Or, one user may contribute information (such as an affiliation) to
            another user&rsquo;s Profile; such information is marked as “unconfirmed” and
            rendered in gray text until it has been confirmed by the Profile owner or other
            reliable validator of factual information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some email addresses are designated “confirmed email addresses” when the user has
            clicked on a link sent to that email address by the OpenReview system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some names are designated “confirmed names” when the user presses the save button
            in a profile containing those names.
          </p>
          <p>
            All “Profile” information can be viewed publicly on your OpenReview profile page,
            with two exceptions:{' '}
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Email addresses are obfuscated by showing email domain only. Full email addresses
              are, however, shared with Venue Organizers (such as journal editors and program
              chairs, who may at their discretion further share with subordinates, such as
              action editors or area chairs). Designation as a “Venue Organizer” is granted at
              the discretion of the OpenReview Staff.
            </li>
            <li>
              Selected conflicts-of-interest and other relations may be hidden by the Profile
              owner from all but a designated list of readers. For example, designated readers
              may include certain Venue Organizers selected by the Profile owner.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The Profile owner may directly change or modify all Profile information, except
            confirmed email addresses and confirmed names (although these may be changed at
            special request by sending email to{' '}
            <a href="mailto:profiles@openreview.net">profiles@openreview.net</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The Edit history of Profile content is stored in the system, available to the
            Profile owner, the creator of the Profile-edit in question, and the OpenReview
            Database administrators.
          </p>
          <strong>Information gathered upon submission of articles and comments</strong>
          <p>
            Registered users may submit to OpenReview Venues Articles, Comments, and other
            Works, such as reviews and discussion. The content data fields are specified by the
            Venue Organizers. Additional Metadata fields gathered by the OpenReview system
            include the account name of the person submitting the content, and date of
            submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the content submission and moderation process we link user accounts, authorship,
            and submitted content to track and process submissions. Data provided by the
            submitter may include, for example, author names, author emails, and submitter
            name, all of which may be displayed (depending on the readability policy of the
            Venue) with the article posting, email announcement of articles, and bulk metadata
            access via API. It is the responsibility of the submitter to obtain appropriate
            consent from any other person whose information the submitter provides.
          </p>
          <strong>Other Information you may provide us voluntarily</strong>
          <p>
            Users may voluntarily provide other information, such as when they email OpenReview
            support (<a href="mailto:info@openreview.net">info@openreview.net</a>) for
            technical help requests. Users may also submit other types of information
            voluntarily through the OpenReview web site, such as ratings, reviewing bids, tags,
            comments, and preferences. Such information will be used in accordance with this
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <h3>How we use information about you that we collect</h3>
          <p>
            We use the information that we collect to better understand how users use the
            System, to support efforts to improve Users&rsquo; experience through refining
            existing features and developing new features, and to optimize the System. We also
            use the information to administer the OpenReview API and website and verify
            accounts and activity and to monitor suspicious activity to help prevent abuse. In
            addition, we use and make available the information for the OpenReview Purpose and
            scientific communication purpose for which it was provided. Furthermore, if you
            email us about an issue, we will use your information to respond to your question.
            We will also use your information to communicate with you regarding the OpenReview
            System and your account with us.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Control Responsibility</h3>
          <p>
            The Venue Organizers and other Solicitors are considered the stewards and managers
            of Works for which they are the Solicitor, not OpenReview, which serves merely as
            the repository. Venue Organizers and other Solicitors are also stewards and
            managers of content about you that you did not submit, such as the assignment of
            reviewers to Submissions. The Venue Organizers and other Solicitors determine when,
            to whom, and how much of your information in Works they solicit is shared with
            others. More specifically, OpenReview and OpenReview Staff are a Data Controller
            (in the GDPR sense) only for Works for which “OpenReview.net” is the Solicitor.
            With respect to all other Works, OpenReview is a Data Processor but not a Data
            Controller; in this case the Data Controller is the Work&rsquo;s Solicitor (for
            example, the Venue soliciting the Article Submissions).
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to submit an Article or any other Work, it is important that you
            understand the terms and conditions set by the Solicitor. The practices regarding
            the level of openness vary throughout OpenReview.net, as determined by the
            Solicitor. For example, depending on the policies of a Venue, content submitted by
            users to that Venue may be freely accessible and available to any third-party use.
            Your Submission of a Work constitutes your acceptance of the level of sharing
            planned by the applicable Solicitor.
          </p>

          <h3>With whom we share your information</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Venue Organizers, other Solicitors, and other Users.</strong> Generally
            speaking, information sharing choices are determined by the Venue or other
            Solicitor of Works containing the information. (The Solicitor is the Data
            Controller, while OpenReview, OpenReview Staff, and the OpenReview System are the
            Data Processors.) When a user responds to a Solicitor&rsquo;s invitation to upload
            a Work to the OpenReview System, that work is stored in the OpenReview Database,
            and assigned readers, nonreaders, and writers according to the parameters of the
            Solicitor&rsquo;s invitation. The OpenReview System will thus share the Work you
            upload according to the Work&rsquo;s “readers” and “nonreaders” Database fields.
            Users with “write” permission (typically the Venue Organizers and Authors) to the
            Work may also be invited to modify the Work, including its “readers” and
            “nonreaders” fields. Typically the Venue or other Solicitor publicly discloses its
            intended workflow, and Submitters can thus know in advance the schedule and extent
            of information sharing planned.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Service Providers.</strong> We use third party service providers to help us
            operate the OpenReview System. These third party vendors have access to some
            information about our Users, but they are required to protect the confidentiality
            of the information and to use it only on our behalf. The types of service providers
            with which we share include providers of email services, other communication
            services, website development, website hosting, analytics, and security.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Legal compliance.</strong> OpenReview will also share information about
            users when required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action
            is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or to respond to a court order,
            subpoena or search warrant. We will also share information if we believe that it is
            necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of OpenReview or others. If we
            share information about you for this reason, we will use reasonable efforts to
            inform you of this disclosure, unless we are prohibited by law from doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Business Transactions.</strong> We may also share information in connection
            with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or
            acquisition of all or a portion of our business.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Consent.</strong> We will also share your information in the event that you
            consent to us sharing it in a certain way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>De-identified Information.</strong> If we have de-identified your
            information such that it can no longer be linked directly to you, we may use and
            share such de-identified information for purposes of analyzing, debugging, or
            improving the OpenReview System and OpenReview Purpose.
          </p>

          <h3>Protecting your information</h3>
          <p>
            No method of transmitting data over the internet or storing electronic data is 100%
            secure, but OpenReview aims to provide technical and organizational methods to
            protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information that is under
            our control.
          </p>

          <h3>Third Party Website Links</h3>
          <p>
            There are links from OpenReview to other websites that we neither own nor control.
            OpenReview is not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or web
            accessibility needs on these websites. These websites have their own privacy
            policies and your visiting these websites from our website is subject to those
            website&rsquo;s own terms and policies. This Privacy Policy covers only information
            collected through OpenReview.net.
          </p>

          <h3>Do Not Track Signals</h3>
          <p>
            Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users may set in certain web
            browsers. We do not currently respond to DNT signals.
          </p>

          <h3>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
          <p>
            If you are located within the European Economic Area (European Union, Norway,
            Liechtenstein, the United Kingdom, and Iceland), we acknowledge the rights granted
            to you under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and provide you with
            some additional information required by the GDPR in this section.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Legal Bases for Processing.</strong> We use a variety of legal bases for
            processing your information, as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Legitimate Interests. We will process your information when it is in our
              legitimate business interests to do so, such as analyzing use of the services,
              communicating with you, enhancing the services, and for other internal business
              operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Performance of a contract. We will process your information where it is necessary
              to provide the services of the OpenReview Terms of Use and OpenReview Purpose to
              you and other OpenReview Users, including to manage your registration and provide
              you with access to the System.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consent. We will process your information when you give us consent to process it
              for particular purposes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Data Subject Rights. </strong> The GDPR offers the following rights to EU
            data subjects:

            <li>
              Right to restrict processing of your personal information in specific situations
